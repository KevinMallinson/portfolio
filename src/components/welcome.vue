						<h4>About Me</h4>
						<p>
							Since I was young, I had a passion for code. Cultivated when I was 16 by making
							a very successful mod for Tony Hawk's Underground 2, along with other hobby projects.
							Eventually I decided that since I loved coding, it was to be my career - and it was a great choice.
							Being able to do what I love every day, engaging my mind with complex problems and solving them is 
							such a rewarding feeling and the reason I enjoy what I do, day in and day out.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next to this, you will see my most practiced skills, which I often perform my professional work in. 
							These are in order: .NET Core, C#, ASP.NET Core, JavaScript, Vue, and Entity Framework Core.
